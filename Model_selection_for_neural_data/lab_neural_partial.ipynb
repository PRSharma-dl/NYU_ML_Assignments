    "# Lab:  Model Selection for Neural Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a key tool for neuroscientists to understand how sensory and motor signals are encoded in the brain. In addition to improving our scientific understanding of neural phenomena, understanding neural encoding is critical for brain machine interfaces. In this lab, you will use model selection for performing some simple analysis on real neural signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing this lab, you should review the ideas in the [polynomial model selection demo](./polyfit.ipynb).  In addition to the concepts in that demo, you will learn to:\n",
    "* Load MATLAB data\n",
    "* Formulate models of different complexities using heuristic model selection\n",
    "* Fit a linear model for the different model orders\n",
    "* Select the optimal model via cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The last stage of the lab uses LASSO estimation for model selection.  If you are doing this part of the lab, you should review the concepts in [LASSO demonstration](./prostate.ipynb) on the prostate cancer  dataset.  "

    "\n",
    "Neurons are the basic information processing units in the brain.  Neurons communicate with one another via *spikes* or *action potentials* which are brief events where voltage in the neuron rapidly rises then falls.  These spikes trigger the electro-chemical signals between one neuron and another.  In this experiment, the spikes were recorded from 196 neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1) of a monkey using an electrode array implanted onto the surface of a monkey's brain.  During the recording, the monkey performed several reaching tasks and the position and velocity of the hand was recorded as well.  \n",

    "The goal of the experiment is to try to *read the monkey's brain*:  That is, predict the hand motion from the neural signals from the motor cortex.\n",

For each value of `d`, use K-fold validation with 10 folds to estimate the test RSS.  For a data set this size, each fold will take a few seconds to compute, so it may be useful to print the progress."
